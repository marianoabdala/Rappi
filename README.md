# Single responsibility principle
It's the principle by which each type (class, struct, enum, protocol) should have a single responsibility or purpose. This serves as means to keep classes small, reusable and testable.

# Good code
Good code should be easy to read, to understand, to reuse and to refactor. Good code should be self-explainatory. Good code should go straight to the point, be brief and lack any unnecessary artifact.
